## About

Productivity-Boosting Python Tools for Windows. Thought I'd become far more productive if I not only identified my bottlenecks but also realise as a dev, I can just patch any productivity flaws?

### Task Reminder

*This is a script to remind me to take a break*
*from coding and do some exercise.*
